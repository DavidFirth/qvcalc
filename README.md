# qvcalc

![CRAN Status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/qvcalc)
  
The **qvcalc** package provides _R_ functions to compute and display *quasi-variances* that often allow a more economical 
summary of the variance-covariance matrix for parameters in a statistical model.

Full package documentation, including version history, can be viewed at https://davidfirth.github.io/qvcalc .

For more details on the statistical method, see the references below. 

<!-- The web page at http://warwick.ac.uk/qvcalc gives information 
also about an online calculator implemented in _JavaScript_, for those who do not use *R*. -->

To install the package from CRAN (in _R_):
```
install.packages("qvcalc")
```
