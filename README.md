This repository is where the CRAN package **qvcalc** is maintained.  The package URL on CRAN is https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/qvcalc/index.html .

The **qvcalc** package provides functions to compute and display *quasi-variances* that often allow a more economical 
summary of the variance-covariance matrix for parameters in a statistical model.

For more details, see the references below and the web page at http://warwick.ac.uk/qvcalc (which gives information 
also about an online calculator implemented in javascript, for those who do not use *R*).

The package version to be found here is the development version, snapshots of which are published periodically on CRAN.  If you want to install this development version in *R*, then you can for example use:

    library(devtools)
    install_github(DavidFirth/qvcalc)
